			<h1>Descendants of the Sun</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Yoo Si-jin, a captain in the South Korean Army's special forces, and his friend Master Sergeant Seo Dae-young witness a young man stealing a motorcycle. They apprehend the thief and take him to the hospital. Si-jin meets Dr. Kang Mo-yeon, who mistakenly assumes he's part of the thief's criminal gang. They date, but their dates are interrupted due to Si-jin being called in for duty. They discuss their differing views on life, with Si-jin as a soldier and Mo-Yeon as a doctor. They part ways due to their philosophical differences, and Dae-young faces a dilemma about continuing his relationship with Myung-Ju or risking being forced out of the army.</p>
			<p>Elise Rainier and her team, including psychic Elise Rainier, help Josh project his consciousness into the purgatory dimension called "The Further," inhabited by tortured spirits of the deceased. Josh accuses Elise of being a scam artist but later discovers drawings in Dalton's room that confirm her theory. Elise helps Josh overcome his fear and frees him from the demon. The spirits of The Further invade the real world, terrorizing Renai, Elise, and others. Josh is confronted by the old woman who tormented him as a child and tries to overcome her fear. The family celebrates their victory, but Elise becomes angry when she takes a photo of Josh, revealing that he is now possessed by the ghost of the old woman from his childhood.</p>
