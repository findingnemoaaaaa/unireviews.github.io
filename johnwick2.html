			<h1>John Wick: Chapter 2</h1>
			<br>
			<p>John Wick retrieves his stolen Ford Mustang from Abram Tarasov and dispatches Tarasov's men in a violent rampage, causing significant damage but spares Tarasov under the promise of peace. John is visited by Camorra crime boss Santino D'Antonio, who reminds him of his help in completing his "impossible task" and allows him to retire and marry Helen. John swore to a "marker," an unbreakable vow symbolized by a "blood oath" medallion, which Santino presents to demand services from John. John declines, and Santino retaliates by destroying John's house with a grenade launcher. John survives and travels to the Continental Hotel in New York City, where he is reminded that rejecting the marker violates one of the underworld's two unbreakable rules: no killing on Continental grounds and honoring every marker.</p>
			<p>John infiltrates Gianna's coronation in Rome, Italy, and shoots her in the head to fulfill the marker. As Gianna dies, John shoots her in the head to end her suffering and fulfill the marker. John flees to the catacombs, where he is double-crossed by Ares and Santino's henchmen, who intend to tie up "loose ends" by killing him. John is pursued by Cassian, who promises him a quick and clean death as a sign of professional respect.</p>
			<p>Julius arranges safe passage for John back to New York, and Santino opens a contract for $7 million to kill John, ostensibly to avenge his sister's death. John is injured from multiple attempted assassinations and is confronted by Cassian in the subway. John spares Cassian, and seeks help from the Bowery King, an underground crime boss. The Bowery King gives John a Kimber M1911 pistol with only seven bullets, one for each million of the contract. John pursues Santino, killing his remaining henchmen, including Ares, and escapes to the Continental. Winston announces John's "excommunicado" and provides him with a marker for future use. John advises Winston to warn every other High Table assassin that he will kill anyone who tries to hunt him. John leaves with his dog, and Winston activates his "excommunicado" in one hour..</p>

		<h2>Comment:</h2>
		<p>"John Wick: Chapter 2" expands on the established environment by adding new layers of complexity. It delves into the secret society of assassins and their hierarchy, with the Continental Hotel serving as a focal point. The film also digs deeper into the character of John Wick, addressing his motivations, emotional journey, and terrible occurrences. Keanu Reeves adds layers to his deadly talents with quiet ferocity and tenderness.</p>
